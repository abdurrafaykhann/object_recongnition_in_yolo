# Object_detection
The aim of this project is to develop an object recognition system using YOLOv8 for detecting objects within a simulated soccer field environment in Webots. The goal is to accurately recognize and locate three key classes: ball, goalpost, and NAO robot players, using RGB images captured in simulation.
